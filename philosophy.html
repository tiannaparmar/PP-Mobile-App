    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <br>
    
     <p2>
     Hello, I am Tianna Parmar from the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa's graduating class of 2023.
     I'm a 14-year-old student who is fueled by ambition and innovation through sustainability and passion.

     <br>
     <br>
   
     I intend to reduce the impact of food wastage and create awareness amongst the population, 
     through my goal of building a mobile-app and a website from the ground up. One of my several
     inspirations and learning curves was sought from the Middle School Model United Nations (MSMUN)
     conferences. Through the years MSMUN taught me a lot about the UN's mission/vision through the 17 Sustainable 
     Development Goals (SDG's), in which my project mainly tackles 2 SDG's. Goal number two, zero hunger which
     aims to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, and goal number twelve, responsible consumption
     and production which aims address the issue of global food waste at the supplier and consumer levels
     which is important for creating more efficient production and supply chains. (United Nations,n.d.).
      
     <br>
     <br>

     <h2>The Process</h2>

     <br>
     

     <p2>
       In early 2020 I was introduced to the Personal Project which is a culminating Middle Years Programme(MYP)
       project, in the International Baccalaureate curriculum (IB).

       <br>
       <br>

       The project aims to develop a student's personal intrest and for the student to show and apply the skills,
       which are developed through the MYP's Approaches to Learning. This project is based on a student's intrests
       and talents, resulting in a product or outcome. The project is a year-long project, which begins in 
       grade 9 (MYP 4) and ends in grade 10 (MYP 5) and thus, the journey began.
